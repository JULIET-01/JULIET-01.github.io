<h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
<p>
    Emotional intelligence is understanding your emotions. Using this knowledge allows individuals to manage and use emotions well. 
    Emotional intelligence allows for reduced stress, awareness of others, effective communication, conflict resolution, ability to adapt 
    and grow. Realisation that you are not your thoughts, you have an ego that wants to steer the ship is the first step to creating emotional 
    intelligence. This can be practiced through an awareness of self and sensations in the body, tense muscles, headaches, sweating, etc. Also 
    noticing thoughts that are coming up regularly, or in certain situations or with people. Emotional intelligence is taking a step back, watching 
    yourself and others nonjudgmentally. From there you can assess what is correct and true and the next best action. The key is self-compassion 
    for ourselves and others. I often say hi to these sensations in my body. I thank them for turning up and for trying to show me something, 
    they are there for a reason. For example, when fear turns up, I say "I see you fear, thank you for being there, thank you for wanting to 
    keep me safe, I understand why you are here, I can feel tension and unease in my body." In turn, I tell my body and fear that I am safe 
    and ok, given it's not life-threatening, I scan my body through meditation which helps relax my muscles:) Emotional intelligence is having 
    a window into yourself, others, and the world around you. It can be practiced in many ways, journaling, meditation, mindfulness or attention 
    training, prayer, conscious listening. </p>


<p>  “Eventually you will see that the real cause of problem is not life itself. It's the commotion the mind makes about life that really causes the problems.”
― Michael A. Singer, The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself </p> 

<p>“True personal growth is about transcending the part of you that is not okay and needs protection.”
― Michael A. Singer, The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself </p>

<p>“There is nothing more important to true growth than realizing that you are not the voice of the mind - you are the one who hears it”
― Michael A. Singer, The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself </p>

<p>To realize that you are not your thoughts is when you begin to awaken spiritually. - Eckhart Tolle </p>
