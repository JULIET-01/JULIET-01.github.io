<h1>Learning Plan</h1>
<div><h4>JULIET BLACK | DEV ACADEMY | 04.07.2021</h4></div>
<br>

<p>I expect to find employment as soon as I can when I complete my time at EDA. Iâ€™m interested to see which aspects, of learning, spark my interests. 
I'm still understanding what types of roles are available and what skills set will be required. I'm excited to take on the challenge of job hunting 
and networking.</p>

<h3>Strengths and limitations to learning</h3>
<p>Being a visual person I can take a little longer to grasp the technical parts of learning. Once I see it done or have someone explain it to me, 
things begin to click. I learn through visuals and audio, sometimes saying the words out loud helps to make things clearer.</p>

<p>I can get lost in how things look and spend a lot of time making work look good. This is the designer in me. I will need to balance the detail 
work with just getting things done and meeting the core requirements. Focusing on the technical and understanding this solidly first will be important.</p>

<p>I've been a solo show for many years. The majority of my work has been self-employed, working alone. While I have really enjoyed this, I am 
going to notice the difference between working in teams and interacting with a larger audience. I will need to make sure I am 
participating fully and engaging well with the group, understanding I have something to contribute to the wider group. </p>

<p>My need to have things done well can sometimes hold me back. I'm learning to break tasks down into bite-size pieces, take them one step at a time.</p> 

<p>Also having the designer skills will help overall coupled with technical skills. Having an eye for composition, heirachy and typography.
As a designer you learn to define the problem, research, listen and understand the target audience. These skills help in a learning environment, 
balancing big picture thinking with practical detail and implementation thinking. </p>

<h3>Developing human skills while at EDA</h3>
<p>I would love to build confidence in myself and my ability to learn, grow and gain skills for a work environment. As I've always been self-employed 
it is hard to imagine myself in a workplace environment, I've often thought about who will hire me if I haven't had previous contract employment. 
I'd like to have a voice and participate in groups, getting to know and understand how I can help others best, and lean into learning from others 
more. I haven't thought of myself as a technical person in the past, I am challenging those thoughts.</p>

<p>I will be fully committed to managing my workload and time. Respecting my commitment to learning, investing in myself, and honoring EDA and teammates. 
I will keep track of my hours, sticking with the time suggestions and noticing when I have gone over. A plan will be put in place if I am falling behind. 
This plan will be for myself and others I'm working with. I will communicate, openly, and honestly in my interactions. I understand the importance of 
having clear and timely communication, even if it's difficult it's important. </p>

<p>If things are building up, I will do my best to have an awareness around what is happening and either take time out to resolve on my own through journaling, 
meditation, a walk, or reaching out to the support provided with facilitators and other learners. </p>

<h3>Facilitators Role</h3>
<p>A description of what I expect from the facilitation team. I understand the facilitators are there to talk any matters through, both personal and technical. 
They are overseeing our progress in technical skills and providing a framework for build our human skills. Weekly video check ins through foundations, 
and availability on campus.</p>

<h3>Personal Comittments</h3>
<p>Every second week I will be with my three children solo parenting. I have hired a nanny and cleaner to help manage my home commitments. 
I have school drop-off/pick-up organised. I understand when things get quite busy weekends will be managed with extra help. Some wonderful 
friends have offered to help during the busy period. </p>
