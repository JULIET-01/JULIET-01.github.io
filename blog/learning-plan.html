    <h1>Foundations Learning Plan</h1>
    <div>
        <h4>JULIET BLACK | DEV ACADEMY | 04.07.2021</h4>
    </div>
    <br>

    <p>I expect to find employment as soon as I can when I complete my time at EDA. I’m interested to see which aspects
        of learning spark my interest.
        I'm still understanding what types of roles are available and what skill set will be required. I'm excited to
        take on the challenge of job hunting
        and networking.</p>

    <h3>Strengths and limitations to learning</h3>
    <p>Being a visual person I can take a little longer to grasp the technical parts of learning. Once I see it done or
        have someone explain it to me,
        things begin to click. I learn through visuals and audio, sometimes saying the words out loud helps to make
        things clearer.</p>

    <p>I can get lost in how things look and spend a lot of time making work look good. This is the designer in me. I
        will need to balance the detail
        work with just getting things done and meeting the core requirements. Focusing on the technical and
        understanding this solidly first will be important.</p>

    <p>I've been a solo show for many years. The majority of my work has been self-employed, working alone. While I have
        really enjoyed this, I am
        going to notice the difference between working in teams and interacting with a larger audience. I will need to
        make sure I am
        participating fully and engaging well with the group, understanding I have something to contribute to a wider
        audience. </p>

    <p>There are times when I get overwhelmed with tasks, or focus on a small aspect and not move along at a good pace.
        I'm learning to break tasks down
        into bite-size pieces, take them one step at a time.</p>

    <p>Also having the designer skills will help overall coupled with technical skills. Having an eye for composition,
        heirachy and typography.
        As a designer you learn to define the problem, research, listen and understand the target audience. These skills
        help in a learning environment,
        balancing big picture thinking with practical detail and implementation thinking. </p>

    <h3>Developing human skills while at EDA</h3>
    <p>I would love to build confidence in myself and ability to learn, grow and gain skills for a work environment. As
        I've always been self-employed
        it is hard to imagine myself in a workplace environment, I've often thought who will hire me if I haven't had
        previous contract employment.
        I'd like to have a voice and participate in groups, and understand how I can help others best, and lean into
        learning from others
        more. I haven't thought of myself as a technical person in the past, I am challenging those thoughts.</p>

    <p>I will be fully committed to managing my workload and time. Respecting my commitment to learning, investing in
        myself, and honoring the EDA staff and my teammates.
        I will keep track of my hours, sticking with the time suggestions and noticing when I have gone over. A plan
        will be put in place if I am falling behind.
        This plan will be for myself and others I'm working with. I will communicate, openly, and honestly in my
        interactions. I understand the importance of
        having clear and timely communication, even if it's difficult, it's important. I will be repsectful in the
        language I use, giving honest feedback and open to recieving feedback.</p>

    <p>If things are building up, I will do my best to have an awareness around what is happening and either take time
        out to resolve on my own through journaling,
        meditation, a walk, managing tasks appropriately, or reaching out to the support provided with facilitators and
        other learners. </p>

    <h3>Facilitators Role</h3>
    <p>I understand the facilitators are there to talk any matters through, both personal and technical. Overseeing our
        progress in technical skills
        and providing a framework for build our human skills. Weekly video check ins through foundations, and
        availability on campus.</p>

    <h3>Personal Comittments</h3>
    <p>Every second week I will be with my three children solo parenting. I have hired a nanny and cleaner to help
        manage my home commitments.
        I have school drop-off/pick-up organised. I understand when things get quite busy weekends will be managed with
        extra help. Some wonderful
        friends have offered to help during the busy period. </p>


    <h1>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
    <div>
        <h4>JULIET BLACK | DEV ACADEMY | 25.07.2021</h4>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3>What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>My long-term goal is to get employment as a front-end developer. Finding a career that intersects programming with
    design. I am interested to see what parts of study during Bootcamp spark my interests.</p>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
   <p>My biggest strengths would be to work hard and persist. I am by nature self-reflective while this can help me
    understand what is going on, I do need to quieten my inner critic. My biggest limitation will be going easy on
    myself, I won’t know all the answers and that is ok. I am not a failure when things are
    difficult is often a challenge. While I find it easy to extend understanding to others, I will work on applying this
    to myself as well.</p>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
    <p>Not feeling too overwhelmed. Often if something feels too big I get stuck and don’t know where to start. Breaking tasks
     down into smaller parts, steping back and starting again with a new perspective will help. Also taking time out for myself,
    knowing this is important too. Keeping a good balance, even if it’s small breaks away from working.</p>

    <h3>Expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
    <p>I’ve enjoyed working with the team at EDA during foundations. I’ve felt welcomed and supported. I expect that EDA
    will teach us what we need to know when we need to know it, providing a framework around learning and guidance with
    tech and emotional support. My expectations from the whole Bootcamp team, we will work well together, be accountable to each other, 
    respectful and support each other while we learn.</p>

    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>I expect myself to grow as a person and in my knowledge of programming. As much as I put in I
    will get out of my time during Bootcamp, I will be putting a lot of effort into my learning. I will communicate
    clearly and well with others, being open to new ideas and ways of thinking. I can overcome difficult problems by
    using problem-solving techniques. Managing time and self well. Providing support for others where I can, while also
    getting it in return when needed. I expect this to challenge me personally for the better. Growth happens in difficult things.</p>
