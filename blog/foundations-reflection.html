    <h3>Core learning</h3>
    <p>I have learned many new things over the last 5 weeks! Three of the core learnings were firstly the importance of
        bringing emotional intelligence into learning and interacting in a team setting. I’ve understood the importance
        of bringing EQ into my everyday relationships, but see the benefit of applying this into a professional setting.
        Often I’ve seen myself in different roles, Juliet in this context, then Juliet in another context. Isntead of
        of compartmentalising, we bring the same values, empathy, self-awareness and emotional intelligence into all aspects of
        our lives, for the better! The second part was listening and looping. I enjoyed this technique and can see the
        benefit of it. Realising how often I am forming what I will say, while the person is still talking. Being
        able to be fully present while someone is talking is a wonderful skill. Taking in what they have said then
        reflecting that back and taking turns to say your part. I have been trying to practise this skill, noticing the
        pattern of not being fully engaged while others are talking but instead running over how that applies to me,
        what I will say next, or what jobs I need to do that day for example. This is a practise around staying present
        and fully in the moment. The third thing I learned was how our brains can change, even physically. Hearing the
        science that backs what happens to our brain while learning is fascinating and helpful to know while taking on new learning
        myself! </p>

    <h3>Role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming.</h3>
    <p>It is important to bring clear values, empathy, and self-awareness into learning and programming. This makes us
        able to take on new challenges, being kind to ourselves in the process, allowing for a growth mindset and the
        ability to persist and continue to grow. We can also extend this awareness and empathy towards others. If we are
        to be effective programmers we will need to work well with others. Teamwork requires many skills, if we aren’t
        able to bring EQ into these environments then we can’t be effective programmers. </p>

    <h3>Core learning surprises</h3>
    <p>I have been surprised at the amount of core skills we were focusing on, but understand why. I can see the benefit
        of learning the core skills alongside the tech challenges. We were able to put the core learning to the test.
        Having a strong foundation in core skills from the beginning of our coding journey is essential. There will be
        lots of time to use these new skills going forward. Self-reflection is a key part of learning, I can see the
        importance of writing our blog and documenting what core learning covered. </p>

    <h3>Expectations from the Bootcamp team.</h3>
    <p>While at times I wanted to be coding, feeling like I was getting behind I see the benefits of core learning.
        Understanding that if we are to be effective programmers, it will require us to have a solid foundation of self.
        Employers will be looking for people that can join a team and add the culture of that place. We will need to
        work well with others, in environments with lots of different people, values, and outlooks. Awareness of self
        and others will help us navigate </p>

    <h3>EDA / Core learning</h3>
    <p>I expect myself to grow as a person and in my knowledge of programming. As much as I put in I
        will get out of my time during Bootcamp, I will be putting a lot of effort into my learning. I will communicate
        clearly and well with others, being open to new ideas and ways of thinking. I can overcome difficult problems by
        using problem-solving techniques. Managing time and self well. Providing support for others where I can, while
        also getting it in return when needed. I expect this to challenge me personally for the better. Growth happens when we 
        have the courage to stretch ourselves.</p>
