<h2>The differnce between HTML and CSS</h2>
<p>
    HTML defines the overall structure and elements of the web page and CSS defines the visual style. This allows 
    you have structure/content and presentation seperate from each other. When HTML and CSS talk together you get 
    a webpage that is ideally well structured and looks great! You’re able to maintain and update these two sides 
    of your webpage. To get HTML and CSS to talk you add a link to your HTML so it knows to refer back to the 
    stylesheet you’ve supplied. 
</p>

<p>
    HTML is like the builder, makes sure everything is in it’s place and built well. Then the CSS interior 
    designer walks in and chooses colours, tones, textures, good layout flow plus more. Adds style and the wow factor. 
</p>
<p>
    The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programme, it lets us access the documents on the web and
    its elements. The DOM allows us to move through the logical structure of documents, manipulating it and making
    it more dynamic. It’s the equivalent of a map for your HTML,CSS and browser. The DOM helps us interact with our
    pages, so we know where to go, add something, change, find, track and much more. It’s like a giant magnifying
    glass that goes in deep. It looks at all parts of your webpage. 
</p>

<p> Moving through the DOM is called traversing through the 'DOM tree'. A tree like structure that keeps to parent,
    sibling relationships within the code. Every element in a document is called a node—the document as a whole, the
    head, tables within the document, table headers, text within the table cells—is part of the document object model.
    The DOM can be manipulated with scripting languages like JavaScript. When you modify the DOM it returns it immediately.

<h2>Control flow and loops.</h2>
<p>
Control flow is the way a computer executes statements in a script. Looping is when the computer executes statement but it
loops back on itself. You can run the same code multiple times by using the loop. Loops allow programmers to shorten code,
what might be lots of lines of code is now written once and repeated as many times as needed. A loop is a repeat. <br>
</p>

<p>The “Go put your pyjamas on please” loop. 
An example would be when I ask my lovely children to get ready for bed. “Go put your pyjamas on please” I ask once,
they listen but no-one moves a muscle.  “Go put your pyjamas on please” I ask twice, they listen again but nothing
changes. I ask again  “Go put your pyjamas on please” I might get a slight bit of movement, but there is a lot of
resistance. I repeat my phrase  “Go put your pyjamas on please”, sounding like a broken record I’m loosing patience.  
“Go put your pyjamas on please”I finally see movement and children appear back in-front of me in bed attire. The situation
has changed and I can stop asking. <br>
<br>There are three types of loops;
The for loop, the while loop and the do…while loop. Each run slightly differently but the condition you set for each will run until
it evaluates to false. You must provide the conditions to stop looping, if you don’t it will be caught in an infinite loop. 
“Go put your pyjamas on please”.  “Go put your pyjamas on please”.  “Go put your pyjamas on please”.  “Go put your pyjamas on please”.
“Go put your pyjamas on please”.  “Go put your pyjamas on please”. Me on repeat, no thanks!  </p>

<h2>Accessing Data from Arrays and Objects</h2>
<p>
An array is a like a container that holds a list. The length of an array is established when the array is created. After creation, its length is fixed.
Each item in an array is called an element, and each element is accessed by its numerical index. Each element within the array is placed inside [ ] square
brackets. Accessing data from an array can be done using the index position. This position refers to a memory address in which the
value is saved. Arrays always start at 0, so no.1 in the list looks like this [0]. Arrays cannot use strings to access data, they must
use an integer.
